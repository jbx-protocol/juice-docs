***New website just dropped for the Juicebox Protocol***

After countless workshops, discussions, and pull requests, the website for [juicebox.money](http://juicebox.money) is now live featuring the new homepage, About page, and Success Stories, as well as some exciting new features like improved search and project tags. The new website was made possible by [PeelDAO](https://juicebox.money/@peel), the front end team building and maintaining juicebox.money, and [WAGMI Studios](https://juicebox.money/@wagmi-studios), whose juicy artwork is featured throughout.

You can follow along in the video below or in this article.

### The Homepage

Let‚Äôs get started with the homepage. At the top we‚Äôve got a call-to-action: create a project and *Fund your thing*. And right below you can see a few trending projects built on Juicebox, so you can browse what creators are building and find some projects that align with your values and interests.

<p class="subtitle">Hero: Fund your thing, trending projects</p>


You‚Äôll also notice some categories at the top like DAO, NFT, and Fundraising. Those are a new feature: **Project Tags**! So for example, if you click on DAO you‚Äôll be able to find projects that have added that tag. You can also use tags to filter your searches. Keep in mind that this is a new feature and not too many projects have added tags yet. Give it a try next time you‚Äôre browsing projects.

### Explore Projects

Once you‚Äôre on the Explore page, you‚Äôll also notice that search has been completely revamped so it‚Äôs now way easier to find specific projects or browse to find new ones. Looking for projects by [Krause House](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/436)? Try searching terms like ‚ÄúNBA‚Äù. If you‚Äôre feeling nounish you can search ‚Äúnouns‚Äù and find projects in the Nouns ecosystem like [SharkDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/sharkdao).

### Mental Models for Juicebox

So going back to the homepage, you‚Äôll see a few examples of the different types of projects that you can build with Juicebox. Whether you‚Äôre starting a DAO, crowdfunding for a cause, launching an NFT project, or building something else, you can manage the funds transparently with your community.

### Introducing Success Stories

If you‚Äôd like to know more about past projects that have been successful, we‚Äôve created a new Success Stories section which tells the story behind projects like [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/success-stories/constitutiondao), [MoonDAO](https://juicebox.money/success-stories/moondao), [SharkDAO](https://juicebox.money/success-stories/sharkdao), and [StudioDAO](https://juicebox.money/success-stories/studiodao). Each case study will tell you how the project got started, how they set-up their project on Juicebox, and how they found success.

Banny, along with a fruity assortment of new characters have been reimagined to embrace Juicebox‚Äôs new brand identity. Paired with a slick sans serif Agrandir, a font that ‚Äúcelebrates the beauty of being imperfect,‚Äù the Juicebox brand update keeps the protocol fresh while acknowledging its punk origins.


### New About Page

The Juicebox protocol has grown a lot since its launch in July 2021. From contract versioning and audits to feature developments like tiered NFTs, to metaverse concerts at the Juice Lounge, countless members of Juicebox DAO have shaped what it is today through its active governance. Juicebox doesn‚Äôt drink from the kool-aid, it leverages the power of collective action through its community to help passionate creators and builders successfully launch and scale projects, openly on the Ethereum blockchain.
