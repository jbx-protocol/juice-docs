## Background

**Juicebox's legitimacy as a DAO is built upon sufficient decentralization of power, access, and ownership.** To accomplish this ideal, Juicebox must attract and retain an active community that has Juicebox's long-term interests in mind.

One of the most direct methods for improving decentralization is the airdrop. Several airdrop proposals were made to this effect in FC#15, all of which were rejected.

[JBP-103 - Distribute JBX to JBX Holders](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xa6c744ee55ffb564382f1e2fc557bbf028d90c9680ae5a0518ce406d447baa65)

As part of a new airdrop proposal, ARCx has crafted a *Juicebox Benefits Score* which identifies Juicebox community members based on their token holding behaviour and governance participation.

*See [JBP-114: Juicebox Benefits Airdrop](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth/proposal/0xd10c56f453851063665241417642352beaf8816aca062c29f98b1f5154ff3cdd)*

## Score Methodology

The Juicebox Benefits Program identifies and rewards active community members who hold Juicebox DAO’s long-term interests at heart. The score rewards active contributors by measuring governance participation, and rewards long-term support by measuring how long a wallet has held JBX.

### *Governance Factor (60%)*

The *Governance Factor* measures the number of [Juicebox Snapshot proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/jbdao.eth) that a wallet has voted in. The wallet with the highest Governance score is given 600 points, and the wallet with the lowest score is given zero. All other wallets are linearly scored within those bounds—for example, a wallet that voted in half as many snapshot proposals would be given 300 points.

### *HODL Factor (40%)*

The *HODL Factor* measures the number of UTC dates that a wallet has held at least 1 JBX (either claimed or unclaimed). The wallet with the highest HODL score is given 400 points, and the wallet with the lowest score is given zero. All other wallets are linearly scored within those bounds—for example, a wallet that held JBX for half as many dates would be given 200 points.

## How to Claim

Visit [airdrop.juicebox.money](https://airdrop.juicebox.money/) and connect your wallet to see if you are eligible. You can also claim a free passport to view this score (and other scores) on [arcx.money](https://arcx.money/).

On 2022-06-07 at 22:00 UTC, any unclaimed JBX which remains in the smart contract will be returned to the multisig for future use.

*Your score on arcx.money might not be the same as your score on airdrop.juicebox.money. To prevent sybil attacks, the airdrop scores were measured at Ethereum block 14,263,369.*

## What's Next?

Going forward, the community could use the Juicebox Benefits score to make new airdrops, to set up a gated [Merch Squad collection](https://juicebox.money/#/p/merchsquad), to make gated Discord roles, or even to create exclusive Juicebox-themed [ARCx passport skins](https://arcx.substack.com/p/introducing-defi-passport-skins?s=r). These scores are verifiable onchain, meaning they can be permissionlessly used in smart contracts or used through an API.

Some other examples mentioned by ARCx include:

- Distributing airdrops equitably
- Boosting smart contract staking yields
- Verifying social status via Discord roles
- Offering free smart contract insurance to the best users
- Fee & product discounts
- Many more

This score evolves with your behaviour over time! Although the methodology could evolve, Juicebox Benefits projects aim to reward active contributors which support Juicebox's long-term goals. Your participation and support of Juicebox will be reflected in these scores over time.

If you have ideas or suggestions, share them in the [ARCx Discord](https://discord.gg/arcx) or in `#jbx-benefits` on the [Juicebox Discord](https://discord.gg/6jXrJSyDFf).
