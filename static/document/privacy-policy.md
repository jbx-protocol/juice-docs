We must ensure our compliance with various legal obligations imposed by relevant legislation – anti-money laundering laws, financial services laws, corporation laws, privacy laws and tax laws. For the purpose of auditing our internal processes, fraud prevention and fraud security monitoring purposes, for example, to detect and prevent cyberattacks or attempts to commit identity theft, the usage of stored data is of significant importance. Such obligations and requirements imposed on us necessary personal data processing activities for identity verification, payment processing, compliance with court orders, tax laws or other reporting obligations and anti-money laundering controls.

In case of emails and other communications, [ENTITY NAME] collects and processes your personal data to examine and answer your request.

### 4.2 Legal basis

If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis to handle your signup application and later to manage your personal data as a [ENTITY NAME] user as well as to answer to any email or communications is “the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract” pursuant to Article 6, 1(b) GDPR.

## 5. Storage period

[ENTITY NAME] stores your personal data for a reasonable period of time and never for longer than it is absolutely necessary. In establishing contractual relations with you, [ENTITY NAME] stores your personal data throughout the established relations. Normally, the Organization stores your personal data for 5 (five) years, starting from the beginning of the calendar year following the year of termination of the relationship between us. We may store your personal data for a longer period for reporting, tax and accounting purposes, as well as to protect your legitimate interests. After the expiration of the stipulated terms and if there is no other legal basis for the processing of your personal data, the data will be deleted.

## 6. Disclosure and transfer of personal data

In strict compliance with the legal requirements,  [ENTITY NAME] may disclose or transfer your personal data to the following recipients under particular circumstances:

- With service providers - We may share your information with our service providers and vendors to assist us in providing, delivering, and improving the Services. For example, we may share your wallet address with service providers to provide technical infrastructure services, your wallet address with blockchain analytics providers to detect, prevent, and mitigate financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities, and your activity on our social media pages with our analytics provider to learn more about you interaction with the Services and us.
- To comply with our legal obligations - We may share your data in the course of litigation, regulatory proceedings, compliance measures, and when compelled by subpoena, court order, or other legal procedure. We may also share data when we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to our users, our Organization, or others and to enforce our agreements and policies, including our Terms of Service.
- Safety and Security - We may share data to protect against, investigate, and stop fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity. We may also use it to address security risks, solve potential security issues such as bugs, enforce our agreements, and protect our users, the Organization, and the ecosystem.

We may need to collect or send some personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). For the transfer of personal data to countries or jurisdictions which are not subject to an adequacy decision granted by the European Commission, we will take measures to comply with our legal obligations and all reasonable safeguards to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This information may include transaction data (i.e., purchases, sales, and transfers) related to your blockchain wallet and respective interactions with  [ENTITY NAME] platform. 

Public blockchains are distributed ledgers intended to immutably record transactions across vast networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis, which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data. Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks that are not controlled or operated by the Organization, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data from such networks.
