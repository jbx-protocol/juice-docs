# Analytics

:::info
JuiceboxDAO's analytics are [public](/dao/reference/analytics/).
:::

**Where can you get information to make future decisions?** JuiceboxDAO contributors have built out several tools for you to use:

## Dune Analytics

1. The [Juicebox Project Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/v3) ([v1 here](https://dune.com/juicebox/project-v1)) gives a detailed look into your project's cashflows, payouts, tokens, NFTs, and other trends. Enter your project ID and desired resolution, and then click `Apply all parameters`.
2. The [Juicebox User Dashboard](https://dune.com/juicebox/user) gives an overview of an individual wallet's interactions with various Juicebox projects.
3. The [Juicebox Overview](https://dune.com/juicebox/overview) provides a high-level overview of Juicebox protocol and JuiceboxDAO trends.

## Flipside

1. The [Snapshot Dashboard](https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/snapshot-plus-data-ueqrnb) provides analytics on proposals, voters, and other trends for a Snapshot space.
