# Community

**Where can your community members find each other and collaborate?** Most projects use one or more of the following:

## Communication

### Discord

[Discord](https://discord.gg/) is among the most popular social platforms in crypto. It allows users to create free, invite-only servers for their communities. Discord servers support messaging across multiple channels, voice/video calls, and the configuration of complex permission structures. Discord also supports bots and other automations through its API.

To get started, look at our pre-built [Discord Server Templates/Guide](/user/resources/discord/) for Juicebox projects.

### Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a popular messaging application for mobile and desktop. This is great option if you need a simple tool for real-time chat or to make announcements to your community. Telegram also has an [extensive API](https://core.telegram.org/api) which you can use for bots or other automations.

### Discourse

[Discourse](https://github.com/discourse) is an open source forum used by many web3 projects, including several Juicebox projects. Some projects use it to host formal governance discussion, and others use it for everything.

## Collaboration

### Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is a freemium note-taking and collaboration work space. To get an idea of what it can do, visit the [JuiceboxDAO Notion](https://juicebox.notion.site/Juicebox-Notion-7b2436cec0c145c88b3efa0376c6dba3).
