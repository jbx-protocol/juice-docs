# Governance

Governance: **how your project makes decisions**. Most projects use one of the three options:

## 1. No Governance

Many projects have no need for formal governance â€” the project creator or a small group can make decisions without formal processes. You can add governance later on, when/if the need arises.

## 2. Offchain Governance (Recommended)

:::info
Most projects ratify a Governance Process to use alongside Snapshot voting. Feel free to use [our process](/dao/process/) as a starting point. You can also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox) for help creating a new one.

Although this could be as simple as conducting polls in a Discord server, project creators are advised to use [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org):

> Snapshot is a decentralized voting system. It provides flexibility on how voting power is calculated for a vote. Snapshot supports various voting types to cater to the needs of organizations. Creating proposals and voting on Snapshot is user-friendly and does not cost gas as the process is performed off-chain.
>
> In short, Snapshot is an off-chain gasless multi-governance client with easy to verify and hard to contest results.

You can deploy a Snapshot space for your project on [snapshot.org](https://snapshot.org/#/setup), or you can:

1. Visit your project's page on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) with the project owner wallet connected.
2. Open your project's settings by clicking the gear in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Selecting `Governance` in the left-hand sidebar, and following the instructions on that page.

Both of these options will require you to have an ENS address (this is a short name ending with `.eth` that refers to your wallet). If you don't have an ENS, visit [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains).

Once you have your space set up, you can use one of our [pre-written Snapshot strategies for Juicebox projects](/user/resources/snapshot/). If you're looking for something else, tag `filipvv` in the [Juicebox Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

:::info
JuiceboxDAO contributors have built an [alternative Snapshot interface](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot) with additional features (like search, filtering, and additional analytics).

## 3. Onchain Governance

You can also govern your Juicebox project on-chain. Take a look at:

- [revnets](https://app.revnet.eth.sucks/), a tool to launch trustless juiceboxes.
- [Defifa](https://defifa.net), an onchain sports prediction game built with Juicebox. If you're interested in running a similar competition, inquire in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hrZnvs65Nh).
