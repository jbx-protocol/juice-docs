**How can you help people find your project?** Some popular tools include:

## Twitter

[Twitter](https://twitter.com) has one of the most highly engaged online crypto communities — this should be your top priority!

## YouTube

[YouTube](https://youtube.com) is self explanatory: upload some videos explaining what your project is and how people can support it! YouTube videos can also be great resources for people already in your community.

## A Blog

Writing articles about your project can be a great way to attract online attention. You can either:

- Make your own website,
- use a standard blogging tool like [Medium](https://medium.com/),
- or use a web3 blogging tool like [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/)!

## A Website

Having a landing page to explain your project is a great way to bring in traffic! If you're building your own website, you can use the [`juice-widgets`](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-widgets) repo which has prebuilt assets and embeds for Juicebox projects.

Several Juicebox projects have massively benefited from traditional media coverage — especially ConstitutionDAO and AssangeDAO. If you are aiming to create a large-scale project, media outreach may be beneficial.
