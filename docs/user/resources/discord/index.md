# Discord Server Templates

Discord is among the most popular social platforms in crypto. It allows users to create free, invite-only servers for their communities. Discord servers support messaging across multiple channels, voice/video calls, and the configuration of complex permission structures. Discord also supports bots and other automations through its API.

## Get Discord

If you don't already have an account, create one at [discord.gg](https://discord.gg). You can access Discord via a web browser or through its native apps on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, or Linux. If you are a complete beginner, take a look at Discord's [beginner's guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

## 1. Templates

You will be brought to your new Discord server! Acquaint yourself with the preconfigured channels and roles.

### 1.1 Note on Permissions

Discord permissions are *cumulative*‚Äîusers gain permissions from all of their roles, with positive permissions overriding negative ones. Channel permissions and category permissions behave differently; they override the permissions of users and roles within specific channels. All of the templates come with sensible defaults: non-admin users will not be able to send messages or create discussion threads within information/announcement channels.

To test a role's permissions, click on your server's name (at the top of your channels list), and navigate to your `Server Settings`. Navigate to the `Roles` page, and click on the role you would like to test. Within the `Display` tab, scroll to the bottom and select `View Server as Role ‚Üí`. This will let you test what actions the role can take and what channels it can see.

## 2. Server Settings

Click on your server's name (at the top of your channels list), and navigate to your `Server Settings`. Our templates come with sensible defaults, but you may desire to reconfigure the following options:

|Setting|Sidebar Menu|Description|
|-|-|-|
|**Show Boost progress bar**|Overview|When enabled, a server boost progress bar will display in your channel list. Server boosts allow for further customization.|
|**Upload Emoji**|Emoji|Add custom emojis that anyone can use in your server.|
|**Upload Sticker**|Stickers|Add custom stickers that anyone can use in your server.|
|**Verification level**|Safety Setup|The criteria users must meet before they can send messages.|
|**Enable 2FA Requirement**|Safety Setup|Require members with moderation powers to have two-factor authentication enabled. This setting is recommended.|

## 3. React Roles and Embeds

*React roles* allow server members to easily self-assign roles by reacting to a message. The Discord bot [carl.gg](https://carl.gg) allows server owners to set up react roles, write custom embeds, and configure automod features if desired. To add carl.gg to your server:

1. Visit [carl.gg](https://carl.gg), sign in with your Discord account, and click `Manage` on the home page.
2. Select your server in this menu. You will be redirected to a Discord authentication page. Click `Continue`, then scroll down and click `Authorize`. You may need to fill out a captcha.
3. You will be redirected back to [carl.gg](https://carl.gg). Click `SKIP` to open your dashboard.

### 3.1 Your "README"

2. Open the `Reaction roles` page in the sidebar. Click `Create new reaction role`.
3. In the Mode category, select `Post embed` and select your `#‚ú®ÔΩúread-me` channel. Then click `Show embed builder`.

Type a brief server intro using the `Title` and the `Description` fields. This message will be the first thing users see when they join your Discord server. You can format this message with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

**The title:**
```text

```

**With the description:**

If you have many links, you may want to separate them with bolded category titles. An input of `**Example Text**` will be formatted to: **Example Text**.
