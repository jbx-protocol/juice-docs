If you've run into errors on juicebox.money, you can often resolve them by:

1. Performing a hard refresh. This may differ by browser and operating system, but can typically be done with `CTRL + SHIFT + R` on Windows/Linux and `COMMAND + SHIFT + R` on Mac OS.
2. Click the `Reset Website` button on any error message. **This will clear your browser's local storage. You will lose any in-progress projects.**
3. Try a different browser. Juicebox.money is tested on Chrome-based browsers (including Brave and Edge), as well as Firefox-based browsers.
4. Try a different device. If you are running into trouble on a mobile device, a laptop or desktop computer may work.
