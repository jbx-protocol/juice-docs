Juicebox is a way for anyone to fund, operate, and scale their project on the Ethereum blockchain. It's also one of the best ways to launch a new token or NFT collection. Juicebox has been used by some of the most notable crypto projects:

- [ConstitutionDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/constitutiondao) raised $49.6m across 19,121 payments in a bid to buy an original copy of the United States Constitution at auction, garnering significant media attention along the way. Although they were out-bid in the auction, they were able to use Juicebox to return the funds to their supporters.
- [AssangeDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/assangedao) raised $52.4m to fund Julian Assange's legal defense.
- [MoonDAO](https://juicebox.money/p/moondao) raised ~$8.75m to fund open space research and lunar settlement R&D. They were able to send the [first crowdfunded astronaut](https://youtu.be/YXXlSG-du7c?si=p8khVfYYzF4im4fJ) into space.
- [CryoDAO](https://juicebox.money/@cryodao) raised ~$2.66m to advance cryopreservation science with strategic research grants.

This is only a small sample – people have used Juicebox to fund software projects, companies, art experiments, podcasts, NFT communities, and more: you can see other examples on [juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money/projects?tab=all), which is the most popular website for using Juicebox.

It takes about 10 minutes to create a Juicebox project, which can:

- Receive ETH payments.
- Issue tokens and/or NFTs to those payers, and reserve a percentage of those tokens for you, your team, or a community stockpile. You can use tokens for voting, community access, or other perks. Juicebox has a unique [tokenomics model](tokenomics) which works at any scale – people use Juicebox for projects of all sizes.
- Allow your supporters to cash out their tokens or NFTs to get back some of the ETH you don't need for your payouts. This can be a full refund, a partial refund, or it can be turned off completely.
- Pay your team (or anyone else) with automated payroll or one-time payouts – your payouts can be fixed ETH amounts, ETH amounts based on USD values, or percentages of all the ETH in your project.

All of these rules (like how much you can pay out, how your redemptions work, and how many tokens go to payers) can be updated over time to keep your project's setup up-to-date with your community. But if you could change these rules at any time, you could [rug pull](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/rug-pull) your supporters without any warning, and people would trust your project less. Juicebox lets you find a middle ground with *rulesets* and an *edit deadline*:

1. You decide how long each set of rules ("ruleset") lasts. If a ruleset doesn't have a specific duration, you can change the rules at any time, which might make people worried about rugpulls. But let's say you use a duration of 7 days – that means that your project's rules can't be changed until that 7-day period is over. When you try to change the rules in the middle of the 7 days, those changes get *queued* as the next ruleset, and go into effect once the current set of rules ends. This way, everybody can see changes to your project's rules ahead of time. If you don't queue a new ruleset, the current one gets copied over (with the same duration).
2. This still leaves the question: *what if I change my project's rules at the last second?* That's why you should use an *edit deadline*. With a 3-day edit deadline, you have to queue the changes to your project's rules **at least 3 days** before they would go into effect. If you miss that deadline, your current ruleset (and its duration) gets copied over, and your changes take effect in the ruleset *after* the next one. If you used the 7-day ruleset described above, you would need to queue your changes by the end of day 4 at the latest. If you missed that deadline, the 7-day ruleset would get copied over, and your changes wouldn't go into effect until the end of *that* ruleset.

When you create your Juicebox project, the project's NFT will be sent to your wallet. This NFT is the only way to control your project — the project's rules are managed directly on the Ethereum blockchain, making your project independent, transparent, and uncensorable. Nobody else – not even JuiceboxDAO – can change your project's rules or take its funds, unless the smart contracts which Juicebox runs on get hacked.
