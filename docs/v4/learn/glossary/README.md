| **Project**          | <p>TLDR: A Juicebox project is an NFT (ERC-721) representing ownership and permissions for managing project-specific transactions.</p><p>Each Juicebox project's 721 is managed in the <a href="/v4/core/JBProjects.md"><code>JBProjects</code></a> contract. The owner of this NFT is specified when the project is being created. Ownership over this NFT is used to enforce permissions needed to access several project-oriented transactions. Like any other NFT, ownership can be transferred from the original owner to any other address, such as a multi-sig wallet, voting contract, or burn address.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/project.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Rulesets**    | <p>TLDR: A sequence of configurable, time-locked rules that define how a Juicebox project operates over time.</p><p>A project is expressed in terms of rulesets. A ruleset outlines the time-locked rules according to which a project wishes to operate. It is represented as a <a href="/v4/api/core/structs/JBRuleset"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structure, and managed by the <a href="/v4/core/JBRulesets.md"><code>JBRulesets</code></a> contract.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/ruleset.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Tokens**           | <p>TLDR: Tokens minted for a project based on its ruleset, optionally issued as ERC-20 tokens or integrated with a custom token.</p><p>The Juicebox protocol keeps track of tokens for each project. When a payment is made to a project, the protocol mints tokens for a specified beneficiary according to the project's current ruleset.</p><p>Tokens are managed in the <a href="/v4/core/JBTokens.md"><code>JBTokens</code></a> contract through its controller. Projects can optionally call their controller's <a href="/v4/api/core/JBController.md#deployerc20For"><code>deployERC20For(...)</code> </a>transaction to issue an ERC-20 to represent their token. Once issued, anyone with a project's tokens can claim them from the protocol's internal accounting mechanism into their wallet to use around Web3.</p><p>Projects can also bring their own token, so long as it adheres to the <a href="/v4/api/core/interfaces/IJBToken.md"><code>IJBToken</code></a> interface and uses 18 decimal fixed point accounting.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/tokens.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Surplus**         | <p>TLDR: Funds exceeding a project's payout limit, reclaimable by its community through token cash-outs.</p><p>The <a href="/v4/api/core/JBFundAccessLimits.md"><code>JBFundAccessLimits</code></a> contract has a <a href="/v4/api/core/JBFundAccessLimits.md#payoutlimitof"><code>payoutLimitOf(...)</code></a> property which denotes how much funds a project can distribute to its preprogrammed payout splits during each ruleset. Any funds in the project in excess of the current distribution limit is considered surplus. A project's surplus can be reclaimed by its community by cashing out tokens. A project can specify funds or assets held outside of Juicebox contracts as surplus by attaching a <a href="/v4/api/core/interfaces/IJBRulesetDataHook.md"><code>IJBRulesetDataHook</code></a> to its rulesets.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/surplus.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Weight cut percent**    | <p>TLDR: Defines how a project's token distribution changes over time by reducing its weight in each ruleset cycle.</p><p><a href="/v4/api/core/structs/JBRuleset.md"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structures have a <code>weight</code> property that is automatically derived from multiplying the <code>weight</code> of the previous ruleset by the <code>weightCutPercent</code> of the previous cycle. The weight property is then be used to determine how many project tokens are distributed per unit of payment received during the ruleset, or for any other functionality implemented through a ruleset's data hook and pay hook. A project can also customize its ruleset's weight manually.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/weight-cut-percent.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cash out tax rate**  | <p>TLDR: A project's configurable tax rate on surplus funds when tokens are cashed out.</p><p><a href="/v4/api/core/structs/JBRuleset.md"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structures configured through the <a href="/v4/api/core/JBController.md"><code>JBController</code></a> contract have a <code>cashOutTaxRate</code> metadata property that can be used to determine how much surplus funds can be reclaimed by cashing out project tokens, or for any other functionality implemented in a ruleset's data hook and cash out hook.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/cash-out-tax-rate.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Splits**           | <p>TLDR: Preprogrammed distributions of funds or tokens to addresses, contracts, or Juicebox projects.</p><p>A Split is used to send a percent of a total amount to a preprogrammed address, Juicebox project, contract that inherits from <a href="/v4/api/core/interfaces/IJBSplitHook.md"><code>IJBSplitHook</code></a>, or sender of the transaction causing the distribution to splits. Splits are represented with <a href="/v4/api/core/structs/JBSplit.md"><code>JBSplit</code></a> data structures, and managed by the <a href="/v4/api/core/JBSplits.md"><code>JBSplits</code></a> contract. A split does not hold information about what is being split, it's simply a structure organizable into groups that maps a receiver to a percentage.</p>[Learn more](/docs/v4/learn/glossary/splits.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
