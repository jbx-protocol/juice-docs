# Surplus

#### What everyone needs to know

* A project can set payout limits from its project on a per-ruleset basis using [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#launchprojectfor), [`JBController.launchRulesetsFor(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#launchrulesetsfor), and [`JBController.queueRulesetsOf(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#queuerulesetsof). These limits are stored in [`JBFundAccessLimits.payoutLimitOf(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBFundAccessLimits.md#payoutlimitof). Any funds in the project's Juicebox that exceed its specified distribution limit are considered surplus.
* Surplus serves as a project's runway since future rulesets can tap into it within the bounds of its preconfigured distribution limits. Surplus can also serve as a refund or rebate mechanism, where everyone's net contribution price is pushed towards zero as volume outpaces what the project limits are.
* By default, surplus also serves as a means for allowing community members to cash out with a portion of the project's funds in hand. Any funds in surplus are reclaimable by the project's community by cashing out community tokens along a bonding curve defined by the project's current [cash out tax rate](cash-out-tax-rate.md). Projects can override or extend this functionality using a custom [data hook](ruleset-data-hook.md).
* Projects can manage how much money is in surplus (and therefore how much each member can exit with) either by adjusting its payout limits or by using a custom cash out extension.
* A project can set surplus allowances on a per-ruleset basis within the [`JBController.launchProjectFor(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#launchprojectfor), [`JBController.launchRulesetsFor(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#launchrulesetsfor), and [`JBController.queueRulesetsOf(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBController.md#queuerulesetsof) transactions. These allowances are stored in [`JBFundAccessLimits.surplusAllowanceOf(...)`](/docs/v4/api/core/contracts/JBFundAccessLimits.md#surplusallowanceof). A project's owner can distribute the project's funds from its surplus on-demand up until the preconfigured allowance. Surplus allowances do not reset each ruleset, they last until a new ruleset takes effect.
