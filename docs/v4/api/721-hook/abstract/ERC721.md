```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public virtual;
```

### _ownerOf

*Returns the owner of the `tokenId`. Does NOT revert if token doesn't exist
IMPORTANT: Any overrides to this function that add ownership of tokens not tracked by the
core ERC721 logic MUST be matched with the use of [_increaseBalance](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_increaseBalance-address-uint128-) to keep balances
consistent with ownership. The invariant to preserve is that for any address `a` the value returned by
`balanceOf(a)` must be equal to the number of tokens such that `_ownerOf(tokenId)` is `a`.*


```solidity
function _ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (address);
```

### _getApproved

*Returns the approved address for `tokenId`. Returns 0 if `tokenId` is not minted.*


```solidity
function _getApproved(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (address);
```

### _isAuthorized

*Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `owner`'s tokens, or `tokenId` in
particular (ignoring whether it is owned by `owner`).
WARNING: This function assumes that `owner` is the actual owner of `tokenId` and does not verify this
assumption.*


```solidity
function _isAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

### _checkAuthorized

*Checks if `spender` can operate on `tokenId`, assuming the provided `owner` is the actual owner.
Reverts if `spender` does not have approval from the provided `owner` for the given token or for all its assets
the `spender` for the specific `tokenId`.
WARNING: This function assumes that `owner` is the actual owner of `tokenId` and does not verify this
assumption.*


```solidity
function _checkAuthorized(address owner, address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual;
```

### _increaseBalance

*Unsafe write access to the balances, used by extensions that "mint" tokens using an [ownerOf](/docs/v4/api/721-hook/abstract/ERC721.md#ownerof) override.
NOTE: the value is limited to type(uint128).max. This protect against _balance overflow. It is unrealistic that
a uint256 would ever overflow from increments when these increments are bounded to uint128 values.
WARNING: Increasing an account's balance using this function tends to be paired with an override of the
\{_ownerOf\} function to resolve the ownership of the corresponding tokens so that balances and ownership
remain consistent with one another.*


```solidity
function _increaseBalance(address account, uint128 value) internal virtual;
```

### _update

*Transfers `tokenId` from its current owner to `to`, or alternatively mints (or burns) if the current owner
(or `to`) is the zero address. Returns the owner of the `tokenId` before the update.
The `auth` argument is optional. If the value passed is non 0, then this function will check that
`auth` is either the owner of the token, or approved to operate on the token (by the owner).
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.
NOTE: If overriding this function in a way that tracks balances, see also \{_increaseBalance\}.*


```solidity
function _update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth) internal virtual returns (address);
```

### _mint

*Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use [_safeMint](/docs/v4/api/721-hook/abstract/ERC721.md#_safemint) whenever possible
Requirements:
- `tokenId` must not exist.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.*


```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal;
```

### _safeMint

*Mints `tokenId`, transfers it to `to` and checks for `to` acceptance.
Requirements:
- `tokenId` must not exist.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement [IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-), which is called upon
a safe transfer.
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.*


```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal;
```

### _safeMint

*Same as [`_safeMint`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeMint-address-uint256-), with an additional `data` parameter which is
forwarded in \{IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received\} to contract recipients.*


```solidity
function _safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual;
```

### _burn

*Destroys `tokenId`.
The approval is cleared when the token is burned.
This is an internal function that does not check if the sender is authorized to operate on the token.
Requirements:
- `tokenId` must exist.
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.*


```solidity
function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal;
```

### _transfer

*Transfers `tokenId` from `from` to `to`.
As opposed to [transferFrom](/docs/v4/api/721-hook/abstract/ERC721.md#transferfrom), this imposes no restrictions on msg.sender.
Requirements:
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.*


```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal;
```

### _safeTransfer

*Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC721 standard to prevent tokens from being forever locked.
`data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is sent in call to `to`.
This internal function is like [safeTransferFrom](/docs/v4/api/721-hook/abstract/ERC721.md#safetransferfrom) in the sense that it invokes
\{IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received\} on the receiver, and can be used to e.g.
implement alternative mechanisms to perform token transfer, such as signature-based.
Requirements:
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement \{IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received\}, which is called upon
a safe transfer.
Emits a \{Transfer\} event.*


```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal;
```

### _safeTransfer

*Same as [`_safeTransfer`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_safeTransfer-address-address-uint256-bytes-), with an additional `data`
parameter which is
forwarded in \{IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received\} to contract recipients.*


```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual;
```

### _approve

*Approve `to` to operate on `tokenId`
The `auth` argument is optional. If the value passed is non 0, then this function will check that `auth` is
either the owner of the token, or approved to operate on all tokens held by this owner.
Emits an \{Approval\} event.
Overrides to this logic should be done to the variant with an additional `bool emitEvent` argument.*


```solidity
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth) internal;
```

### _approve

*Variant of `_approve` with an optional flag to enable or disable the \{Approval\} event. The event is not
emitted in the context of transfers.*


```solidity
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth, bool emitEvent) internal virtual;
```

### _setApprovalForAll

*Approve `operator` to operate on all of `owner` tokens
Requirements:
- operator can't be the address zero.
Emits an \{ApprovalForAll\} event.*


```solidity
function _setApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved) internal virtual;
```

### _requireOwned

*Reverts if the `tokenId` doesn't have a current owner (it hasn't been minted, or it has been burned).
Returns the owner.
Overrides to ownership logic should be done to [_ownerOf](/docs/v4/api/721-hook/abstract/ERC721.md#_ownerof).*


```solidity
function _requireOwned(uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (address);
```

### _checkOnERC721Received

*Private function to invoke [IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received-address-address-uint256-bytes-) on a target address. This will revert if the
recipient doesn't accept the token transfer. The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract.*


```solidity
function _checkOnERC721Received(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) private;
```
