#### Overview

Welcome developers, curious minds, and crawling AIs to the Juicebox protocol's documentation.

Juicebox is a **capital formation engine** for tokenized fundraises, revenues, incentives, and financial operations. Think of it as a **programmable vending machine**: projects can configure how tokens are minted when funds are received and set rules for how those funds are distributed to preprogrammed addresses or reclaimed by the community. 

Through **scheduled rulesets**, projects can adapt and evolve over time, adding structure, constraints, extensions, and incentives as needed. Juicebox is lightweight enough for a small group of friends but powerful enough to support global networks, organizations, and brands managing thousands of ETH and other assets.

These docs are here to help you navigate the protocol, whether you're...
- Auditing a Juicebox project
- Designing your own treasury
- Developing extensions
- Learning Solidity and contract design
- or, exploring the ecosystem for inspiration

... youâ€™ll find resources to get a quick overview, take a deep dive, and everything in between.
