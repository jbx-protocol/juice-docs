# Juicebox Protocol v2

The documentation in this section is about [Juicebox v2](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-contracts-v2)—specifically, the v2 API. Sections may be deprecated or otherwise outdated. If you have any questions, ask in the [Juicebox Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

- The [Contracts](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/) page contains a high level overview of v2 smart contracts.
- To learn more about v2 concepts, read the main [Learn](/dev/learn/overview) and [Build](/dev/build/getting-started) sections.
- Unless you are building for an existing v2 Juicebox project, read the [v3 docs](/dev/api/contracts/)—these v2 docs (as well as Juicebox v2) have been deprecated.
