**Distributes payouts for a project with the distribution limit of its current funding cycle.**

_Payouts are sent to the preprogrammed splits. Any leftover is sent to the project's owner._

_Anyone can distribute payouts on a project's behalf. The project can preconfigure a wildcard split that is used to send funds to msg.sender. This can be used to incentivize calling this function._

_All funds distributed outside of this contract or any feeless terminals incure the protocol fee._

#### Definition

```
function _distributePayoutsOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _currency,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  string calldata _memo
) private returns (uint256 netLeftoverDistributionAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project having its payouts distributed.
  * `_amount` is the amount of terminal tokens to distribute, as a fixed point number with same number of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_currency` is the expected currency of the amount being distributed. Must match the project's current funding cycle's distribution limit currency.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum number of terminal tokens that the `_amount` should be valued at in terms of this terminal's currency, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function returns the amount that was sent to the project owner, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Record the distribution.

    ```
    // Record the distribution.
    (JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle, uint256 _distributedAmount) = store.recordDistributionFor(
      _projectId,
      _amount,
      _currency
    );
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`store`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/store.md)

    _External references:_

    * [`recordDistributionFor`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/jbsingletokenpaymentterminalstore/write/recorddistributionfor.md)
2.  Make sure the distributed amount is at least as much as the minimum expected amount.

    ```
    // The amount being distributed must be at least as much as was expected.
    if (_distributedAmount < _minReturnedTokens) revert INADEQUATE_DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT();
    ```

3.  Get a reference to the project's owner. The owner will be allocated any funds leftover once splits are settled.

    ```
    // Get a reference to the project owner, which will receive tokens from paying the platform fee
    // and receive any extra distributable funds not allocated to payout splits.
    address payable _projectOwner = payable(projects.ownerOf(_projectId));
    ```

    _External references:_

    * [`ownerOf`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-ownerOf-uint256-)
4.  The following scoped block is a bit of a hack to prevent a "Stack too deep" error. Define a few variables outside of the scope that'll be set within the scope but later referenced again outside.

    ```
    // Define variables that will be needed outside the scoped section below.
    // Keep a reference to the fee amount that was paid.
    uint256 _fee;

    // Scoped section prevents stack too deep. `_feeDiscount`, `_feeEligibleDistributionAmount`, and `_leftoverDistributionAmount` only used within scope.
    { ... }
    ```

    1.  Get a reference to the discount that'll be used when applying the fee. If the fee is 0, set the discount to be 100% to simplify subsequent calculations. No fee is the same as a full discount.

        ```
        // Get the amount of discount that should be applied to any fees taken.
        // If the fee is zero or if the fee is being used by an address that doesn't incur fees, set the discount to 100% for convinience.
        uint256 _feeDiscount = fee == 0 || isFeelessAddress[msg.sender]
          ? JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT
          : _currentFeeDiscount(_projectId);
        ```

        _Library references:_

        * [`JBConstants`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jbconstants.md)
          * `.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT(...)`

        _Internal references:_

        * [`isFeelessAddress`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/isfeelessaddress.md)
        * [`_currentFeeDiscount`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/read/-_currentfeediscount.md)

    2.  Get a reference to the amount of distributed funds from which fees should be taken, and the amount leftover after distributing splits.

        ```
        // The amount distributed that is eligible for incurring fees.
        uint256 _feeEligibleDistributionAmount;

        // The amount leftover after distributing to the splits.
        uint256 _leftoverDistributionAmount;d
        ```

    3.  Distribute the amount to all payout splits. Get a reference to any leftover amount, and all amounts sent to splits from which fees should be taken.

        ```
        // Payout to splits and get a reference to the leftover amount after all splits have been paid.
        // Also get a reference to the amount that was distributed to splits from which fees should be taken.
        (_leftoverDistributionAmount, _feeEligibleDistributionAmount) = _distributeToPayoutSplitsOf(
          _projectId,
          _fundingCycle.configuration,
          payoutSplitsGroup,
          _distributedAmount,
          _feeDiscount
        );
        ```

        _Internal references:_

        * [`payoutSplitsGroup`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/payoutsplitsgroup.md)
        * [`_distributeToPayoutSplitsOf`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_distributetopayoutsplitsof.md)

    4.  Add the leftover distribution amount to the amount from which fees should be taken since those funds will be leaving the ecosystem to the project owner's address.

        ```
        // Leftover distribution amount is also eligible for a fee since the funds are going out of the ecosystem to _beneficiary.
        unchecked {
          _feeEligibleDistributionAmount += _leftoverDistributionAmount;
        }
        ```

    5.  Take the fee if needed.

        ```
        // Take the fee.
        _fee = _feeDiscount == JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT ||
          _feeEligibleDistributionAmount == 0
          ? 0
          : _takeFeeFrom(
            _projectId,
            _fundingCycle,
            _feeEligibleDistributionAmount,
            _projectOwner,
            _feeDiscount
          );
        ```

        _Library references:_

        * [`JBConstants`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jbconstants.md)
          * `.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT(...)`

        _Internal references:_

        * [`_takeFeeFrom`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_takefeefrom.md)

    6.  Calculate what the net value of the leftover distribution will be.

        ```
        // Get a reference to how much to distribute to the project owner, which is the leftover amount minus any fees.
        unchecked {
          netLeftoverDistributionAmount = _leftoverDistributionAmount == 0
            ? 0
            : _leftoverDistributionAmount - _feeAmount(_leftoverDistributionAmount, fee, _feeDiscount);
        }
        ```

        _Internal references:_

        * [`fee`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/fee.md)
        * [`_feeAmount`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/read/-_feeamount.md)

    7.  Transfer any leftover amount to the project owner if needed.

        ```
        // Transfer any remaining balance to the project owner.
        if (netLeftoverDistributionAmount > 0)
          _transferFrom(address(this), _projectOwner, netLeftoverDistributionAmount);
        ```

        * [`_transferFrom`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_transferfrom.md)

5.  Emit a `DistributePayouts` event with the relevant parameters.

    ```
    emit DistributePayouts(
      _fundingCycle.configuration,
      _fundingCycle.number,
      _projectId,
      _projectOwner,
      _amount,
      _distributedAmount,
      _fee,
      netLeftoverDistributionAmount,
      _memo,
      msg.sender
    );
    ```
