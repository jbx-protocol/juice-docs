**Distributes payouts for a project with the distribution limit of its current funding cycle.**

_Payouts are sent to the preprogrammed splits. Any leftover is sent to the project's owner._

_Anyone can distribute payouts on a project's behalf. The project can preconfigure a wildcard split that is used to send funds to msg.sender. This can be used to incentivize calling this function._

_All funds distributed outside of this contract or any feeless terminals incure the protocol fee._

#### Definition

```
function distributePayoutsOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _currency,
  address _token,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  string calldata _memo
) external virtual override returns (uint256 netLeftoverDistributionAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project having its payouts distributed.
  * `_amount` is the amount of terminal tokens to distribute, as a fixed point number with same number of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_currency` is the expected currency of the amount being distributed. Must match the project's current funding cycle's distribution limit currency.
  * `_token` is the token being distributed. This terminal ignores this property since it only manages one token.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum number of terminal tokens that the `_amount` should be valued at in terms of this terminal's currency, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
* The function can be accessed externally by anyone.
* The function can be overriden by inheriting contracts.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal.md) interface.
* The function returns the amount that was sent to the project owner, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Forward to the internal function.

    ```
    return _distributePayoutsOf(_projectId, _amount, _currency, _minReturnedTokens, _memo);
    ```
