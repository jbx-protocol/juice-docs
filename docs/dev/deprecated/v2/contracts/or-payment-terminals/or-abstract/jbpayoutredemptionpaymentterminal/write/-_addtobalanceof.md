**Receives funds belonging to the specified project.**

#### Definition

```
function _addToBalanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  bool _shouldRefundHeldFees,
  string memory _memo,
  bytes memory _metadata
) private { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to which the funds received belong.
  * `_amount` is the amount of tokens to add, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal. If this is an ETH terminal, this is ignored and msg.value is used instead.
  * `_shouldRefundHeldFees` is a flag indicating if held fees should be refunded based on the amount being added.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
  * `_metadata` is extra data to pass along to the emitted event.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function doesn't return anything.

#### Body

1.  Refund any held fees. This is useful to allow a project to distribute funds from the protocol and subsequently add them back without paying eventually having to pay double fees.

    ```
    // Refund any held fees to make sure the project doesn't pay double for funds going in and out of the protocol.
    uint256 _refundedFees = _shouldRefundHeldFees ? _refundHeldFees(_projectId, _amount) : 0;
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`_refundHeldFees`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_refundheldfees.md)
2.  Record the added funds.

    ```
    // Record the added funds with any refunded fees.
    store.recordAddedBalanceFor(_projectId, _amount + _refundedFees);
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`store`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/store.md)

    _External references:_

    * [`recordAddedBalanceFor`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/jbsingletokenpaymentterminalstore/write/recordaddedbalancefor.md)
3.  Emit a `AddToBalance` event with the relevant parameters.

    ```
    emit AddToBalance(_projectId, _amount, _refundedFees, _memo, _metadata, msg.sender);
    ```

    _Event references:_
