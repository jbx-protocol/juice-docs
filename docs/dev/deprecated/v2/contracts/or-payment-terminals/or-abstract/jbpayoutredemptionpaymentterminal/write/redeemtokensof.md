**Holders can redeem their tokens to claim the project's overflowed tokens, or to trigger rules determined by the project's current funding cycle's data source.**

_Only a token holder or a designated operator can redeem its tokens._

#### Definition

```
function redeemTokensOf(
  address _holder,
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _tokenCount,
  address _token,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  address payable _beneficiary,
  string memory _memo,
  bytes memory _metadata
)
  external
  virtual
  override
  requirePermission(_holder, _projectId, JBOperations.REDEEM)
  returns (uint256 reclaimAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_holder` is the account to redeem tokens for.
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to which the tokens being redeemed belong.
  * `_tokenCount` is the number of project tokens to redeem, as a fixed point number with 18 decimals.
  * `_token` is the token being reclaimed. This terminal ignores this property since it only manages one currency.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum amount of terminal tokens expected in return, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_beneficiary` is the address to send the terminal tokens to.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
  * `_metadata` are bytes to send along to the data source, delegate, and emitted event, if provided.
* Through the [`requirePermission`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-abstract/jboperatable/modifiers/requirepermission.md) modifier, the function is only accessible by the token holder, or from an operator that has been given the [`JBOperations.REDEEM`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jboperations.md) permission by the token holder.
* The function can be overriden by inheriting contracts.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal.md) interface.
* The function returns the amount of terminal tokens that the tokens were redeemed for, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Forward to the internal function.

        _beneficiary,
