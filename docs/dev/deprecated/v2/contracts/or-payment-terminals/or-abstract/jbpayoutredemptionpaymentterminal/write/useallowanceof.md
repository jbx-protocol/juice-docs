**Allows a project to send funds from its overflow up to the preconfigured allowance.**

_Only a project's owner or a designated operator can use its allowance._

_Incurs the protocol fee._

#### Definition

```
function useAllowanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _currency,
  address _token,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  address payable _beneficiary,
  string memory _memo
)
  external
  virtual
  override
  requirePermission(projects.ownerOf(_projectId), _projectId, JBOperations.USE_ALLOWANCE)
  returns (uint256 netDistributedAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to use the allowance of.
  * `_amount` is the amount of terminal tokens to use from this project's current allowance, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_currency` is the expected currency of the amount being distributed. Must match the project's current funding cycle's overflow allowance currency.
  * `_token` is the token being distributed. This terminal ignores this property since it only manages one token.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum number of tokens that the `_amount` should be valued at in terms of this terminal's currency, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_beneficiary` is the address to send the funds to.
* Through the [`requirePermission`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-abstract/jboperatable/modifiers/requirepermission.md) modifier, the function is only accessible by the project's owner, or from an operator that has been given the [`JBOperations.USE_ALLOWANCE`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jboperations.md) permission by the project owner for the provided `_projectId`.
* The function can be overriden by inheriting contracts.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal.md) interface.
* The function returns the amount of tokens that was distributed to the beneficiary, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as the terminal.

#### Body

1.  Forward to the internal function.

    ```
    return _useAllowanceOf(_projectId, _amount, _currency, _minReturnedTokens, _beneficiary, _memo);
    ```
