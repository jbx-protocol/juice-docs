**Holders can redeem their tokens to claim the project's overflowed tokens, or to trigger rules determined by the project's current funding cycle's data source.**

_Only a token holder or a designated operator can redeem its tokens._

#### Definition

```
function _redeemTokensOf(
  address _holder,
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _tokenCount,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  address payable _beneficiary,
  string memory _memo,
  bytes memory _metadata
) private returns (uint256 reclaimAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_holder` is the account to redeem tokens for.
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to which the tokens being redeemed belong.
  * `_tokenCount` is the number of project tokens to redeem, as a fixed point number with 18 decimals.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum amount of terminal tokens expected in return, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_beneficiary` is the address to send the terminal tokens to.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
  * `_metadata` are bytes to send along to the data source, delegate, and emitted event, if provided.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function returns the amount of terminal tokens that the tokens were redeemed for, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Make sure the provided beneficiary of the claimed funds isn't the zero address.

    ```
    // Can't send reclaimed funds to the zero address.
    if (_beneficiary == address(0)) revert REDEEM_TO_ZERO_ADDRESS();
    ```
2.  Define a reference to the project's funding cycle during which the redemption is being made.

    ```
    // Define variables that will be needed outside the scoped section below.
    // Keep a reference to the funding cycle during which the redemption is being made.
    JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle;
    ```
3.  The following scoped block is a bit of a hack to prevent a "Stack too deep" error.

    ```
    // Scoped section prevents stack too deep. `_delegate` only used within scope.
    { ... }
    ```

    1.  Get a reference to the redemption delegate that.

        ```
        IJBRedemptionDelegate _delegate;
        ```

    2.  Record the redemption and get a reference to the funding cycle during which the redemption was made, the terminal token amount that should be reclaimed, a delegate to callback to, and an updated memo.

        ```
        // Record the redemption.
        (_fundingCycle, reclaimAmount, _delegate, _memo) = store.recordRedemptionFor(
          _holder,
          _projectId,
          _tokenCount,
          _memo,
          _metadata
        );
        ```

        _External references:_

        * [`recordRedemptionFor`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/jbsingletokenpaymentterminalstore/write/recordredemptionfor.md)

    3.  Make sure the amount of terminal tokens being reclaimed is at least as much as the specified minimum.

        ```
        // The amount being reclaimed must be at least as much as was expected.
        if (reclaimAmount < _minReturnedTokens) revert INADEQUATE_RECLAIM_AMOUNT();
        ```

    4.  Burn the project's tokens if needed.

        ```
        // Burn the project tokens.
        if (_tokenCount > 0)
          IJBController(directory.controllerOf(_projectId)).burnTokensOf(
            _holder,
            _projectId,
            _tokenCount,
            '',
            false
          );
        ```

        * [`burnTokensOf`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/write/burntokensof.md)

    5.  If a delegate was provided, callback to its `didRedeem` function, and emit an event with the relevant parameters..

        ```
        // If a delegate was returned by the data source, issue a callback to it.
        if (_delegate != IJBRedemptionDelegate(address(0))) {
          JBDidRedeemData memory _data = JBDidRedeemData(
            _holder,
            _projectId,
            _tokenCount,
            _fundingCycle.configuration,
            JBTokenAmount(token, reclaimAmount, decimals, currency),
            _beneficiary,
            _memo,
            _metadata
          );
          _delegate.didRedeem(_data);
          emit DelegateDidRedeem(_delegate, _data, msg.sender);
        }
        ```

4.  If an amount is being reclaimed, send the funds to the beneficiary.

    ```
    // Send the reclaimed funds to the beneficiary.
    if (reclaimAmount > 0) _transferFrom(address(this), _beneficiary, reclaimAmount);
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`_transferFrom`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_transferfrom.md)
5.  Emit a `RedeemTokens` event with the relevant parameters.

    ```
    emit RedeemTokens(
      _fundingCycle.configuration,
      _fundingCycle.number,
      _projectId,
      _holder,
      _beneficiary,
      _tokenCount,
      reclaimAmount,
      _memo,
      msg.sender
    );
    ```
