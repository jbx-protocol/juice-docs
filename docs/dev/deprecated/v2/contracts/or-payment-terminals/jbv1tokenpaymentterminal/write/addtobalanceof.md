#### Definition

```
function addToBalanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  address,
  string calldata _memo,
  bytes calldata _metadata
) external payable virtual override { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to which the funds received belong. This is ignored since this terminal doesn't allow this function.
  * `_amount` is the amount of tokens to add, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal. This is ignored since this terminal doesn't allow this function.
  * `_token` is the token being paid. This terminal ignores this property since it only manages one token. This is ignored since this terminal doesn't allow this function.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event. This is ignored since this terminal doesn't allow this function.
  * `_metadata` is metadata to pass along to the emitted event. This is ignored since this terminal doesn't allow this function.
* The function can be accessed externally by anyone.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpaymentterminal.md) interface.
* The function doesn't return anything.

#### Body
