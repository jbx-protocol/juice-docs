#### Definition

```
function _transferFrom(
  address _from,
  address payable _to,
  uint256 _amount
) internal override { ...}
```

* Arguments:
  * `_from` is the address from which the transfer should originate.
  * `_to` is the address to which the transfer should go.
  * `_amount` is the amount of the transfer, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as this terminal.
* The resulting function is internal to this contract and its inheriters.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBPayoutRedemptionPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal.md) interface.

#### Body

1.  Send the ERC20. If the specified sender is this contract, use the transfer transaction that doesn't require pre-approval. Otherwise, transfer from the specified address.

    ```
     _from == address(this)
      ? IERC20(token).transfer(_to, _amount)
      : IERC20(token).transferFrom(_from, _to, _amount);
    ```
