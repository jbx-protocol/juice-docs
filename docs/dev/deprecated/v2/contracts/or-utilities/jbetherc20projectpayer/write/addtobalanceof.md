Contract: [`JBETHERC20ProjectPayer`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-utilities/jbetherc20projectpayer/README.md)

Interface: [`IJBProjectPayer`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbprojectpayer.md)

**Add to the balance of the specified project.**

#### Definition

```
function addToBalanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  address _token,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _decimals,
  string calldata _memo,
  bytes calldata _metadata
) public payable virtual override { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project that is being paid.
  * `_token` is the token being paid in.
  * `_amount` is the amount of tokens being paid, as a fixed point number. If the token is ETH, this is ignored and msg.value is used in its place.
  * `_decimals` is the number of decimals in the `_amount` fixed point number. If the token is ETH, this is ignored and 18 is used in its place, which corresponds to the amount of decimals expected in msg.value.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
  * `_metadata` is extra data to pass along to the terminal.
* The function can be accessed externally by anyone, or internally from this contract or one that inherits it.
* The function can be overriden by inheriting contracts.
* The function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBProjectPayer`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbprojectpayer.md) interface.
* The function doesn't return anything.

#### Body

1.  If the token isn't ETH, make sure ETH wasn't sent to the function, then transfer the amount of tokens from the message sender to this contract. If the token is ETH, override the specified amount and decimals values with with amount of ETH sent to the function, which is denoted as a fixed point number with 18 decimals.

    ```
    // ETH shouldn't be sent if the token isn't ETH.
    if (address(_token) != JBTokens.ETH) {
      if (msg.value > 0) revert NO_MSG_VALUE_ALLOWED();

      // Transfer tokens to this contract from the msg sender.
      IERC20(_token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    } else {
      // If ETH is being paid, set the amount to the message value, and decimals to 18.
      _amount = msg.value;
      _decimals = 18;
    }
    ```
