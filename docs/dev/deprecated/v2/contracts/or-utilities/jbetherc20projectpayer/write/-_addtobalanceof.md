**Add to the balance of the specified project.**

#### Definition

```
function _addToBalanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  address _token,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _decimals,
  string memory _memo,
  bytes memory _metadata
) internal virtual { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project that is being paid.
  * `_token` is the token being paid in.
  * `_amount` is the amount of tokens being paid, as a fixed point number. If the token is ETH, this is ignored and msg.value is used in its place.
  * `_decimals` is the number of decimals in the `_amount` fixed point number. If the token is ETH, this is ignored and 18 is used in its place, which corresponds to the amount of decimals expected in msg.value.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event.
  * `_metadata` is extra data to pass along to the terminal.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function doesn't return anything.

#### Body

1.  Get a reference to the terminal that should be sent the payment by checking for the project's stored primary terminal for the token being paid.

    ```
    // Find the terminal for the specified project.
    IJBPaymentTerminal _terminal = directory.primaryTerminalOf(_projectId, _token);
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`directory`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-utilities/jbetherc20projectpayer/properties/directory.md)

    _External references:_

    * [`primaryTerminalOf`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/jbdirectory/read/primaryterminalof.md)
2.  Make sure there is a terminal to make a payment towards.

    ```
    // There must be a terminal.
    if (_terminal == IJBPaymentTerminal(address(0))) revert TERMINAL_NOT_FOUND();
    ```

3.  Make sure the number of decimals in the amount being paid matches the number of decimals expected by the terminal.

    ```
    // The amount's decimals must match the terminal's expected decimals.
    if (_terminal.decimalsForToken(_token) != _decimals) revert INCORRECT_DECIMAL_AMOUNT();
    ```

    _External references:_

    * [`decimalsForToken`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbsingletokenpaymentterminal/read/decimalsfortoken.md)

4.  If the token being paid is an ERC20, approve the terminal to spend the amount of tokens from this terminal.

    ```
    // Approve the `_amount` of tokens from the destination terminal to transfer tokens from this contract.
    if (_token != JBTokens.ETH) IERC20(_token).approve(address(_terminal), _amount);
    ```

    _Library references:_

    * [`JBTokens`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jbtokens.md)
      * `.ETH`

    _External references:_

    * [`approve`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#IERC20-approve-address-uint256-)

5.  Keep a reference to the amount to send in the transaction. If the token being paid is ETH, send the value along with the tx.

    ```solidity
    // If the token is ETH, send it in msg.value.
    uint256 _payableValue = _token == JBTokens.ETH ? _amount : 0;
    ```

    _Library references:_

    * [`JBTokens`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jbtokens.md)
      * `.ETH`

5.  Add to the project's balance with the provided properties.

    ```
    // Add to balance so tokens don't get issued.
    _terminal.addToBalanceOf{value: _payableValue}(_projectId, _amount, _token, _memo);
    ```
