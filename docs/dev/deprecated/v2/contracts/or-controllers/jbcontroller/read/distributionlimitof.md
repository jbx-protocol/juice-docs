**The amount of token that a project can distribute per funding cycle, and the currency it's in terms of.**

_The number of decimals in the returned fixed point amount is the same as that of the specified terminal._

### Definition

```
function distributionLimitOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _configuration,
  IJBPaymentTerminal _terminal,
  address _token
) external view override returns (uint256, uint256) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
* `_projectId` is the ID of the project to get the distribution limit of.
* `_configuration` is the configuration during which the distribution limit applies.
* `_terminal` is the [`IJBPaymentTerminal`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbpaymentterminal.md) from which distributions are being limited.
* `_token` is the token for which the distribution limit applies.
* The view function can be accessed externally by anyone.
* The view function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function overrides a function definition from the [`IJBController`](/dev/deprecated/v2/interfaces/ijbcontroller.md) interface.
* The function returns:
  * `distributionLimit` is the distribution limit, as a fixed point number with the same number of decimals as the provided terminal.
  * `distributionLimitCurrency` is the currency from [`JBCurrencies`](/dev/deprecated/v2/libraries/jbcurrencies.md) that the returned distribution limit is in terms of.

#### Body

1.  Get a reference to the packed distribution limit data.

    ```
    // Get a reference to the packed data.
    uint256 _data = _packedDistributionLimitDataOf[_projectId][_configuration][_terminal][_token];
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`_packedDistributionLimitDataOf`](/dev/deprecated/v2/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller/properties/-_packeddistributionlimitdataof.md)
2.  Return the distribution limit, which is in the first 248 bits, and the currency the distribution limit is in terms of, which is in the last 8 bits.

    ```
    // The limit is in bits 0-231. The currency is in bits 232-255.
    return (uint256(uint232(_data)), _data >> 232);
    ```
