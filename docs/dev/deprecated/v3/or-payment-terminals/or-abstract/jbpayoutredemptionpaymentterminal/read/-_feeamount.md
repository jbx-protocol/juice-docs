**Returns the fee amount based on the provided amount for the specified project.**

#### Definition

```
function _feeAmount(
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _fee,
  uint256 _feeDiscount
) private pure returns (uint256) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_amount` is the amount that the fee is based on, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_fee` is the percentage of the fee, out of MAX_FEE.
  * `_feeDiscount` is the percentage discount that should be applied out of the max amount, out of MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The view function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns the amount of the fee, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.

#### Body

1.  Calculate the discounted fee by subtracting the discount from the fee.

    ```
    // Calculate the discounted fee.
    uint256 _discountedFee = _fee -
      PRBMath.mulDiv(_fee, _feeDiscount, JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT);
    ```

    * [`JBConstants`](/dev/api/libraries/jbconstants.md)
      * `.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT`
2.  Return the amount of tokens from the specified amount that should be paid as a fee.

    ```
    // The amount of tokens from the `_amount` to pay as a fee.
    return
      _amount - PRBMath.mulDiv(_amount, JBConstants.MAX_FEE, _discountedFee + JBConstants.MAX_FEE);
    ```
