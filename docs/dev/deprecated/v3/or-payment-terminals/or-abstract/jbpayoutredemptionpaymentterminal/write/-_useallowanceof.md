**Allows a project to send funds from its overflow up to the preconfigured allowance.**

_Only a project's owner or a designated operator can use its allowance._

_Incurs the protocol fee._

#### Definition

```
function _useAllowanceOf(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _currency,
  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  address payable _beneficiary,
  string memory _memo
) private returns (uint256 netDistributedAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to use the allowance of.
  * `_amount` is the amount of terminal tokens to use from this project's current allowance, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_currency` is the expected currency of the amount being distributed. Must match the project's current funding cycle's overflow allowance currency.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum number of tokens that the `_amount` should be valued at in terms of this terminal's currency, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as this terminal.
  * `_beneficiary` is the address to send the funds to.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function returns the amount of tokens that was distributed to the beneficiary, as a fixed point number with the same amount of decimals as the terminal.

#### Body

1.  Record the use of the allowed funds.

    ```
    // Record the use of the allowance.
    (JBFundingCycle memory _fundingCycle, uint256 _distributedAmount) = store.recordUsedAllowanceOf(
      _projectId,
      _amount,
      _currency
    );
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`store`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/store.md)

    _External references:_

    * [`recordUsedAllowanceOf`](/dev/deprecated/v3/jbsingletokenpaymentterminalstore/write/recordusedallowanceof.md)
2.  Make sure the distributed amount is at least as much as the specified minimum.

    ```
    // The amount being withdrawn must be at least as much as was expected.
    if (_distributedAmount < _minReturnedTokens) revert INADEQUATE_DISTRIBUTION_AMOUNT();
    ```

3.  The following scoped block is a bit of a hack to prevent a "Stack too deep" error.

    ```
    // Scoped section prevents stack too deep. `_fee`, `_projectOwner`, `_feeDiscount`, and `_netAmount` only used within scope.
    { ... }
    ```

    1.  Get a reference to the fee.

        ```
        // Get a reference to the fee amount that was paid.
        uint256 _feeAmount;
        ```

    2.  Get a reference to the project owner, who will be the beneficiary of the paid fee.

        ```
        // Get a reference to the project owner, which will receive tokens from paying the platform fee.
        address _projectOwner = projects.ownerOf(_projectId);
        ```

        _Internal references:_

        * [`projects`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/projects.md)

        _External references:_

        * [`ownerOf`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-ownerOf-uint256-)

    3.  Get a reference to the discount that'll be used when applying the fee. If the fee is 0, set the discount to be 100% to simplify subsequent calculations. No fee is the same as a full discount.

        ```
        // Get the amount of discount that should be applied to any fees taken.
        // If the fee is zero or if the fee is being used by an address that doesn't incur fees, set the discount to 100% for convenience.
        uint256 _feeDiscount = fee == 0 || isFeelessAddress[msg.sender]
          ? JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT
          : _currentFeeDiscount(_projectId);
        ```

        _Library references:_

        * [`JBConstants`](/dev/api/libraries/jbconstants.md)
          * `.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT(...)`

        _Internal references:_

        * [`isFeelessAddress`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/properties/isfeelessaddress.md)
        * [`_currentFeeDiscount`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/read/-_currentfeediscount.md)

    4.  Take the fee if needed.

        ```
        // Take a fee from the `_distributedAmount`, if needed.
        _feeAmount = _feeDiscount == JBConstants.MAX_FEE_DISCOUNT
          ? 0
          : _takeFeeFrom(_projectId, _fundingCycle, _distributedAmount, _projectOwner, _feeDiscount);
        ```

        _Library references:_

        * [`JBConstants`](/dev/api/libraries/jbconstants.md)

        * [`_takeFeeFrom`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_takefeefrom.md)

    5.  Send the net amount to the beneficiary if needed.

        ```
        unchecked {
          // The net amount is the withdrawn amount without the fee.
          netDistributedAmount = _distributedAmount - _fee;
        }

        // Transfer any remaining balance to the beneficiary.
        if (netDistributedAmount > 0)
          _transferFrom(address(this), _beneficiary, _netAmount);
        ```

        * [`_transferFrom`](/dev/deprecated/v3/or-payment-terminals/or-abstract/jbpayoutredemptionpaymentterminal/write/-_transferfrom.md)

4.  Emit a `UseAllowance` event with the relevant parameters.

    ```
    emit UseAllowance(
      _fundingCycle.configuration,
      _fundingCycle.number,
      _projectId,
      _beneficiary,
      _amount,
      _distributedAmount,
      netDistributedAmount,
      _memo,
      msg.sender
    );
    ```
