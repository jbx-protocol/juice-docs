| **Project**          | <p>TLDR: A Juicebox project is an NFT (ERC-721) representing ownership and permissions for managing project-specific transactions.</p><p>Each Juicebox project's 721 is managed in the <a href="/v5/core/JBProjects.md"><code>JBProjects</code></a> contract. The owner of this NFT is specified when the project is being created. Ownership over this NFT is used to enforce permissions needed to access several project-oriented transactions. Like any other NFT, ownership can be transferred from the original owner to any other address, such as a multi-sig wallet, voting contract, or burn address.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/project.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Rulesets**    | <p>TLDR: A sequence of configurable, time-locked rules that define how a Juicebox project operates over time.</p><p>A project is expressed in terms of rulesets. A ruleset outlines the time-locked rules according to which a project wishes to operate. It is represented as a <a href="/v5/api/core/structs/JBRuleset"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structure, and managed by the <a href="/v5/core/JBRulesets.md"><code>JBRulesets</code></a> contract.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/ruleset.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Tokens**           | <p>TLDR: Tokens minted for a project based on its ruleset, optionally issued as ERC-20 tokens or integrated with a custom token.</p><p>The Juicebox protocol keeps track of tokens for each project. When a payment is made to a project, the protocol mints tokens for a specified beneficiary according to the project's current ruleset.</p><p>Tokens are managed in the <a href="/v5/core/JBTokens.md"><code>JBTokens</code></a> contract through its controller. Projects can optionally call their controller's <a href="/v5/api/core/JBController.md#deployerc20For"><code>deployERC20For(...)</code> </a>transaction to issue an ERC-20 to represent their token. Once issued, anyone with a project's tokens can claim them from the protocol's internal accounting mechanism into their wallet to use around Web3.</p><p>Projects can also bring their own token, so long as it adheres to the <a href="/v5/api/core/interfaces/IJBToken.md"><code>IJBToken</code></a> interface and uses 18 decimal fixed point accounting.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/tokens.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Surplus**         | <p>TLDR: Funds exceeding a project's payout limit, reclaimable by its community through token cash-outs.</p><p>The <a href="/v5/api/core/JBFundAccessLimits.md"><code>JBFundAccessLimits</code></a> contract has a <a href="/v5/api/core/JBFundAccessLimits.md#payoutlimitof"><code>payoutLimitOf(...)</code></a> property which denotes how much funds a project can distribute to its preprogrammed payout splits during each ruleset. Any funds in the project in excess of the current distribution limit is considered surplus. A project's surplus can be reclaimed by its community by cashing out tokens. A project can specify funds or assets held outside of Juicebox contracts as surplus by attaching a <a href="/v5/api/core/interfaces/IJBRulesetDataHook.md"><code>IJBRulesetDataHook</code></a> to its rulesets.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/surplus.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Weight cut percent**    | <p>TLDR: Defines how a project's token distribution changes over time by reducing its weight in each ruleset cycle.</p><p><a href="/v5/api/core/structs/JBRuleset.md"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structures have a <code>weight</code> property that is automatically derived from multiplying the <code>weight</code> of the previous ruleset by the <code>weightCutPercent</code> of the previous cycle. The weight property is then be used to determine how many project tokens are distributed per unit of payment received during the ruleset, or for any other functionality implemented through a ruleset's data hook and pay hook. A project can also customize its ruleset's weight manually.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/weight-cut-percent.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Cash out tax rate**  | <p>TLDR: A project's configurable tax rate on surplus funds when tokens are cashed out.</p><p><a href="/v5/api/core/structs/JBRuleset.md"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structures configured through the <a href="/v5/api/core/JBController.md"><code>JBController</code></a> contract have a <code>cashOutTaxRate</code> metadata property that can be used to determine how much surplus funds can be reclaimed by cashing out project tokens, or for any other functionality implemented in a ruleset's data hook and cash out hook.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/cash-out-tax-rate.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Currencies**      | <p>TLDR: Juicebox uses a dual currency system with standard currency IDs (1 for ETH, 2 for USD) and token-specific currencies derived from token addresses.</p><p>A project's token issuance is always relative to a base currency defined in its ruleset metadata, regardless of which tokens it accepts payments in. Token currencies are calculated as uint32(uint256(tokenAddress)), making the native token have currency ID 61166. Projects can accept payments in multiple tokens across different blockchains while maintaining consistent token issuance relative to their base currency through the JBPrices contract.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/currencies.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Controller** | <p>TLDR: The contract responsible for managing a Juicebox project's core operations, including ruleset configuration, token minting, and splits.</p><p>The Controller is a central contract in the Juicebox protocol that allows project owners to configure and update their project's rulesets, manage token issuance, and control how splits are set. It interacts with other core contracts such as [`JBRulesets`](/docs/dev/v5/api/core/JBRulesets.md), [`JBTokens`](/docs/dev/v5/api/core/JBTokens.md), and [`JBSplits`](/docs/dev/v5/api/core/JBSplits.md) to enforce project logic. Each project must choose a controller, and projects desiring custom behavior can deploy custom controllers to extend or modify how the project works.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/controller.md) |

| **Reserved tokens**  | <p>TLDR: A percentage of newly minted tokens reserved for specific addresses or allocations.</p><p><a href="/v5/api/core/structs/JBRuleset.md"><code>JBRuleset</code></a> data structures configured through the <a href="/v5/api/core/JBController.md"><code>JBController</code></a> contract have a <code>reservedPercent</code> metadata property which specifies the percentage of tokens minted as a result of newly received payments that should be reserved for distribution to preprogrammed reserved token splits.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/reserved-tokens.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Splits**           | <p>TLDR: Preprogrammed distributions of funds or tokens to addresses, contracts, or Juicebox projects.</p><p>A Split is used to send a percent of a total amount to a preprogrammed address, Juicebox project, contract that inherits from <a href="/v5/api/core/interfaces/IJBSplitHook.md"><code>IJBSplitHook</code></a>, or sender of the transaction causing the distribution to splits.

Loans include multiple fees: a 2.5% $NANA fee from the juicebox protocol, a 1% REV fee from the revnet protocol, and a variable source fee from the revnet being borrowed from that can be prepaid. The more you prepay in fees upfront, the longer you can hold the loan without additional charges.</p>[Learn more](/docs/dev/v5/learn/glossary/loans.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
