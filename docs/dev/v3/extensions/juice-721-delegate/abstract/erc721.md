Inherits: [`Context`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Context.sol), [`ERC165`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#ERC165), [`IERC721`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721), [`IERC721Metadata`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/IERC721Metadata.sol)

_Doesn't track balances._

Implementation of https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721[ERC721] Non-Fungible Token Standard, including
the Metadata extension, but not including the Enumerable extension, which is available separately as
ERC721Enumerable.

## State Variables

### \_name

```solidity
string private _name;
```

string private _symbol;
```

## Functions

### \_initialize

_Initializes the contract by setting a `name` and a `symbol` to the token collection._

```solidity
function _initialize(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) internal;
```

### supportsInterface

_See IERC165-supportsInterface._

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual override(ERC165, IERC165) returns (bool);
```

### balanceOf

_Balance tracking to be overriden by childs_

```solidity
function balanceOf(address owner) external view virtual override returns (uint256 balance);

```

### \_baseURI

Base URI for computing tokenURI. If set, the resulting URI for each
token will be the concatenation of the `baseURI` and the `tokenId`. Empty
by default, can be overridden in child contracts.

```

### setApprovalForAll

_See IERC721-setApprovalForAll._

function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public virtual override;
```

function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) public view virtual override returns (bool);
```

### transferFrom

_See IERC721-transferFrom._

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override;
```

### safeTransferFrom

_See IERC721-safeTransferFrom._

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) public virtual override;
```

### safeTransferFrom

_See IERC721-safeTransferFrom._

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) public virtual override;
```

### \_safeTransfer

Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.
`data` is additional data, it has no specified format and it is sent in call to `to`.
This internal function is equivalent to safeTransferFrom, and can be used to e.g.
implement alternative mechanisms to perform token transfer, such as signature-based.
Requirements:

- `from` cannot be the zero address.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received, which is called upon a safe transfer.
  Emits a Transfer event.

```solidity
function _safeTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) internal virtual;
```

### \_exists

Returns whether `tokenId` exists.
Tokens can be managed by their owner or approved accounts via approve or setApprovalForAll.
Tokens start existing when they are minted (`_mint`),
and stop existing when they are burned (`_burn`).

```solidity
function _exists(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

### \_isApprovedOrOwner

Returns whether `spender` is allowed to manage `tokenId`.
Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.

```solidity
function _isApprovedOrOwner(address spender, uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

### \_mint

Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
Requirements:

- `tokenId` must not exist.
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
  Emits a Transfer event.

```solidity
function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
```

### \_burn

Destroys `tokenId`.
The approval is cleared when the token is burned.
Requirements:

- `tokenId` must exist.
  Emits a Transfer event.

```solidity
function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
```

### \_transfer

Transfers `tokenId` from `from` to `to`.
As opposed to transferFrom, this imposes no restrictions on msg.sender.
Requirements:

- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
  Emits a Transfer event.

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
```

### \_approve

Approve `to` to operate on `tokenId`
Emits an Approval event.

```solidity
function _approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
```

### \_setApprovalForAll

Approve `operator` to operate on all of `owner` tokens
Emits an ApprovalForAll event.

```solidity
function _setApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved) internal virtual;
```

### \_requireMinted

_Reverts if the `tokenId` has not been minted yet._

```solidity
function _requireMinted(uint256 tokenId) internal view virtual;
```

### \_checkOnERC721Received

Internal function to invoke IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received on a target address.
The call is not executed if the target address is not a contract.

```solidity
function _checkOnERC721Received(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory data) private returns (bool);
```

**Parameters**

| `data`    | `bytes`   | bytes optional data to send along with the call               |

**Returns**

| Name     | Type   | Description                                                       |
| -------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<none>` | `bool` | bool whether the call correctly returned the expected magic value |

### \_beforeTokenTransfer

Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
and burning.
Calling conditions:

- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `from`'s `tokenId` will be
  transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `tokenId` will be minted for `to`.
- When `to` is zero, `from`'s `tokenId` will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
  To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using Hooks].

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
```

### \_afterTokenTransfer

Hook that is called after any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.
Calling conditions:

- when `from` and `to` are both non-zero.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
  To learn more about hooks, head to xref:ROOT:extending-contracts.adoc#using-hooks[Using Hooks].

```solidity
function _afterTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual;
