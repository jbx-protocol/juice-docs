| **Project**          | <p>Each Juicebox project is represented as an NFT (ERC-721), managed in the <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbprojects/"><code>JBProjects</code></a> contract. The owner of this NFT is specified when the project is being created. Ownership over this NFT is used to enforce permissions needed to access several project-oriented transactions. Like any other NFT, ownership can be transferred from the original owner to any other address, such as a multi-sig wallet, voting contract, or burn address.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/project.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Funding cycle**    | <p>A project is expressed in terms of funding cycles. A funding cycle outlines the time-locked rules according to which a project wishes to operate. It is represented as a <a href="/dev/api/data-structures/jbfundingcycle"><code>JBFundingCycle</code></a> data structure, and managed by the <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbfundingcyclestore/"><code>JBFundingCycleStore</code></a> contract.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/funding-cycle.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Tokens**           | <p>The Juicebox protocol keeps track of tokens for each project. When a payment is made to a project, the protocol mints tokens for a specified beneficiary according to the rules of the project's current funding cycle.</p><p>Tokens are managed in the <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbtokenstore/"><code>JBTokenStore</code></a> contract. Projects can optionally call its <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbtokenstore/write/issuefor"><code>issueFor(...)</code> </a>transaction to issue an ERC-20 to represent their token. Once issued, anyone with a project's tokens can claim them from the protocol's internal accounting mechanism into their wallet to use around Web3.</p><p>Projects can also bring their own token, so long as it adheres to the <a href="/dev/api/interfaces/ijbtoken"><code>IJBToken</code></a> interface and uses 18 decimal fixed point accounting.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/tokens.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Overflow**         | <p>The <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbfundaccessconstraintsstore/"><code>JBFundAccessConstraintsStore</code></a> contract has a <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbfundaccessconstraintsstore/#distributionlimitof"><code>distributionLimitOf(...)</code></a> property which denotes how much funds a project can pull from its treasury to distribute to its preprogrammed payout splits during each funding cycle. Any funds in the treasury in excess of the current distribution limit is considered overflow. A project's overflow can be reclaimed by its community by redeeming tokens. A project can specify treasury funds or assets held outside of Juicebox contracts by attaching a <a href="/dev/api/interfaces/ijbfundingcycledatasource"><code>IJBFundingCycleDataSource</code></a> to its funding cycles.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/overflow.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Discount rate**    | <p><a href="/dev/api/data-structures/jbfundingcycle"><code>JBFundingCycle</code></a> data structures have a <code>weight</code> property that is automatically derived from multiplying the <code>weight</code> of the previous funding cycle by the <code>discountRate</code> of the previous cycle. The weight property can then be used to determine how many project tokens are distributed per unit of payment received during the funding cycle, or for any other functionality implement through a funding cycle's data source and delegates. A project can also customize its funding cycle's weight manually.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/discount-rate.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Splits**           | <p>A Split is used to send a percent of a total amount to a preprogrammed address, Juicebox project, contract that inherits from <a href="/dev/api/interfaces/ijbsplitallocator"><code>IJBSplitAllocator</code></a>, or sender of the transaction causing the distribution to splits. Splits are represented with <a href="/dev/api/data-structures/jbsplit"><code>JBSplit</code></a> data structures, and managed by the <a href="/dev/api/contracts/jbsplitsstore/"><code>JBSplitsStore</code></a>. A split does not hold information about what is being split, it's simply a structure organizable into groups that maps a receiver to a percentage.</p>[Learn more](/dev/learn/glossary/splits.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
