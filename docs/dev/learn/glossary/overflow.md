# Overflow

#### What everyone needs to know

* A project can set distribution limits from its treasury on a per funding cycle basis using [`JBController3_1.launchProjectFor(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#launchprojectfor) and [`JBController3_1.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#reconfigurefundingcyclesof). These limits are stored in [`JBFundAccessConstraintsStore.distributionLimitOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/jbfundaccessconstraintsstore/#distributionlimitof). Any funds that are in the project's Juicebox treasury that it hasn't specified as distributable are considered overflow.
* Overflow serves as a project's runway since future funding cycles can tap into it within the bounds of the preconfigured distribution limits. Overflow can also serve as a refund or rebate mechanism, where everyone's net contribution price is pushed towards zero as volume outpaces what the project needs.
* By default, overflow also serves a means for allowing community members to exit with a portion of the treasury's funds in hand. Any funds in overflow are reclaimable by the project's community by redeeming community tokens along a bonding curve defined by the project's current [redemption rate](redemption-rate.md). Projects can override or extend this functionality using a custom [data source](data-source.md).
* Projects can manage how much money is in overflow (and therefore how much each member can exit with) either by adjusting its distribution limits or by using a custom redemption extension.
* A project can set overflow allowances from its treasury on a per-funding-cycle-configuration basis within the [`JBController3_1.launchProjectFor(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#launchprojectfor) and [`JBController3_1.reconfigureFundingCyclesOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/or-controllers/jbcontroller3_1/#reconfigurefundingcyclesof) transactions. These allowances are stored in [`JBFundAccessConstraintsStore.overflowAllowanceOf(...)`](/dev/api/contracts/jbfundaccessconstraintsstore/#overflowallowanceof). A project's owner can distribute the project's funds from its overflow on-demand up until the preconfigured allowance. Overflow allowances do not reset each funding cycle, they last until a new funding cycle reconfiguration takes effect.
