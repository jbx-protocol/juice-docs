#### General Guidelines

- Anybody can create a social media account for JuiceboxDAO, even if we already have an account on that platform.
- JuiceboxDAO is decentralized. There are no "official" accounts.
- Anybody can suggest posts for any one of these platforms, but the final say comes down to the responsible contributor (usually the person who created the account). Share your draft/post in the visibility channel of [our Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox) and tag the responsible contributor for help improving it.
- Try to coordinate major announcements across multiple platforms over Discord.

#### Twitter

- If you have something to share, tag @juiceboxETH for a retweet (not guaranteed).
- For more serious announcements (from the @juiceboxETH account), write a draft and share it in the visiblity channel of [our Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox). Tag @jango.
- Avoid the "crypto grifter" tweeting style if possible. This usually involves excessive use of finger pointing emojis.

#### Blog

- Blog posts are written in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and added to the [juice-docs repo](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-docs).
- Your post should either go in `/blog`, or into one of the subdirectories under `/blogs`.
- Read [this page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) to learn about you should name your file and format your frontmatter.
- Make a pull request.

#### YouTube

- If you would like upload access, ask filipv and he might give it to you. Otherwise, share your video on Discord and somebody might upload it.
- If you do share a video, please also share a title, description, and [properly formatted chapter timestamps](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9884579).
