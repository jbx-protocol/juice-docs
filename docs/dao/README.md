# About JBX 

JBX runs as a business investing in the development of the Juicebox protocol and the ecosystem around it, enabling global capital formation for people and projects.

JBX's finances and developments are accounted for entirely in the open, and it invests growth oriented open source initiatives. To participate, read the [contributing guide](contribute) and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

We believe open operations established entirely on blockchains gives investors, builders, and consumers access to the global internet market at an unprecedented scale, while reducing risks of intermediary control. The Juicebox protocol serves as a tool to establish competative business models that support the open internet's success.

### Who makes up the JBX organization?

From [JBX & Fees](/dao/jbx/):

> Juicebox is developed by an open organization of JBX holders. JBX has no CEO, no hiring department, and no Board of Directors; instead, it is operated by JBX token holders with financial stake in its success. By using tokens and the Juicebox protocol itself, the organization is able to manage strategic decisions and build the Juicebox protocol and ecosystem without at a global scale entirely through the internet.
