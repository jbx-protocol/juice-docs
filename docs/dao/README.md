# About JuiceboxDAO

JuiceboxDAO invests in the development of the Juicebox protocol and the ecosystem around it, enabling global capital formation for people and projects.

JuiceboxDAO's finances and developments are accounted for entirely in the open, and it invests exclusively in open source initiatives. To participate, read the [contributing guide](contribute) and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox).

We believe open operations established entirely on blockchains gives investors, builders, and consumers access to the global internet market at an unprecedented scale, while reducing risks of intermediary control.

### Who is Juicebox DAO?

From [JBX & Fees](/dao/jbx/):

> Juicebox is developed by JuiceboxDAO. JuiceboxDAO has no CEO, no hiring department, and no Board of Directors; instead, it is self-governed by the $JBX token. "DAO" stands for *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* — by using token governance and the Juicebox platform, JuiceboxDAO is able to manage strategic decisions and build the Juicebox protocol and ecosystem.
