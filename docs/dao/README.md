# About JuiceboxDAO

JuiceboxDAO contributors build the Juicebox protocol and the ecosystem around it, enabling projects to raise thousands of ETH and to build robust communities around their projects.

JuiceboxDAO contributors build in the open — to participate, read the [contributing guide](contribute) and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/juicebox). We have Discord Town Halls every Tuesday at 22:00 UTC. [Read about previous ones](/town-hall) or stop by and say hello!

<summary>Governance</summary>

Juicebox governance runs on a [14 day cycle](process) – proposals receive "temperature checks" in Discord, and are ratified in the DAO's [Snapshot space](https://juicetool.xyz/snapshot/jbdao.eth). You can follow this through our governance portal [jbdao.org](https://jbdao.org), or read our [Governance Process](process) to learn more.

### Who is Juicebox DAO?

From [JBX & Fees](/dao/jbx/):

> The Juicebox protocol is developed by JuiceboxDAO. JuiceboxDAO has no CEO, no hiring department, and no Board of Directors; instead, it is self-governed via the JBX token. "DAO" stands for _Decentralized Autonomous Organization_ — by utilizing token governance and the Juicebox protocol itself, JuiceboxDAO is able to manage strategic decisions, payouts to contributors, and to consistently deliver upgrades to a best-in-class Ethereum protocol, along with a powerful suite of tools to support it.
