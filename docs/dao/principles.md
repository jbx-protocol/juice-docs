# JuiceboxDAO Principles 

#### Mission statement

*What JBX works toward*

JBX helps people fund, operate, and scale capital formation for the open internet.

#### Ownership 

*What does it mean to be a JBX owner*

JBX holders are responsible for proposing and voting on:

- how the organization's resources are allocated.
- changes to the protocol the organization has agreed to steward, see [administration](/docs/dev/v5/learn/administration.md).
- changes to formal processes the organization has agreed to follow.
- criteria for ownership expansion and boundaries for cashing out.

Ownership is represented via the JBX token issued using the Juicebox protocol itself. All JBX holders are owners.

Owners can cash out by burning any portion of their tokens at any time and take with them a portion of the organization's ETH stored in its Juicebox.
