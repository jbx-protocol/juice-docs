| JB Project Payer Extension ‚Äì Tokens Receiver | [jacopo.eth](https://twitter.com/jj_ranalli) | This project extends `JBETHERC20ProjectPayer` which makes it possible for JB treasuries to integrate with Slice, and more in general to receive ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens. This basically turns the contract into a NFT vault for JB treasuries, while allowing projects to use Slice protocol and split payments or sell anything fully on-chain via decentralized stores. | [Contracts](https://github.com/slice-so/jbpayer-tokens-receiver), [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/jjranalli/scaffold-jb-project) ||

| Partially Automated Luxury Juicebox Governance | [horsefacts.eth](https://twitter.com/eth_call) | A factory for managing Juicebox projects with the OpenZeppelin Governor stack. The JBGovernorFactory contract deploys an ERC20Votes token, governor, and timelock, swaps a project's Juicebox token for a governance compatible JBVotesToken, and transfers ownership of the project NFT to a timelock controller. Your Juicebox project ERC20s can now be used to govern Juicebox project parameters, rather than relying on a trusted admin who owns the project NFT! | [GitHub](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/jbx-governor) ||
