### Criteria

Make an interesting project! Criteria is subjective and up to token recipients.

Our wish list:
- A scaffold-eth starter kit for buidling a Juicebox project frontend.
- A Juicebox protocol [extension](/docs/v4/deprecated/v3/build/treasury-extensions/README.md) starter kit. See [this repo](https://github.com/jbx-protocol/juice-extensions-collection).
- A scaffold-eth NFT branch that sends funds to a Juicebox treasury. *See [tiles.art](https://tiles.art)*
- A [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf) clone: A sequential tokenID nft auction every x hours that pipes funds into a Juicebox treasury.
- An all-in-one [multisig.lol](https://multisig.lol) + Juicebox interface, with full read/write.
- A buidl-guidl-centric dapp for managing the group's Juicebox treasury.
- A [nifty.ink](https://nifty.ink/) fork which sends funds to a Juicebox treasury.
