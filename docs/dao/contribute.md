# Contributing to JuiceboxDAO

JuiceboxDAO has an open proposal process accessible from [Nance](https://nance.app/s/juicebox), and all communications are done publicly within the [Juicebox DAO Discord server](https://discord.gg/juicebox/). There is no core team with outsized power, the best contributors and decision makers build leverage with $JBX holders on their own.

For more up-to-date context, join the weekly [Discord Town Halls](/town-hall) (Tuesday 23:00 UTC, check the discord for the latest time).
